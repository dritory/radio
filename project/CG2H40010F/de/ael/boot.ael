// boot.ael - This file resides in the de/ael directory of the design
// kit. It is loaded by the design kit infrastructure software if it is
// listed in the file ads.lib in one of 4 predefined locations, one of
// which is $HOME/hpeesof/design_kit. This file is used to load other
// AEL files such as palette.ael. It is also used to set up some
// global variables for use in other files.
// One global variable that is available by default:
// designKitRecord - this is a list which contains the 4 fields from
//                   ads.lib (kit name, path, boot file, version).
// As soon as the design kit load process has finished, this variable
// is unset, so save the values as a variable with a different name if
// you want access to them later.
//
// The following debug print statements can be used to view the values of 
// these variables:
//
// To print a field in the list:
fputs(stderr, designKitRecord[0]);
// Now save the path variable so it is available for later use.
// Any variables declared in this file must be unique to this design kit.
// If you copy this boot file to make another design kit, these names must
// be changed.

// To view the path variable:
fputs(stderr, CG2H40010F_PATH);
// Comment out all debug print statements before shipping your design kit.
// These path names will be used later to load other files.
